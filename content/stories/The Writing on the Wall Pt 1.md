When I was a young girl, dad told me that if I wrote a thought out, it would exist forever.

And so I did.

I wrote out every thought I deemed worthy of immortality. Every single one. In my journal, on windows, in my class notebook, on the walls. I painted my world with them. One day, I took it upon myself to display one of my favourite thoughts at home. I equipped myself with a red marker and made a canvas of the wall beside the staircase. I wrote it as large as I could. Maybe that way, it could exist in someone else’s forever as well as mine.

Mum and Dad came home from their party that night. Dad was the first to reach the door. Quickly, I assumed my position on the landing, ready for my grand unveiling. As soon as he turned the light on, he would see me, eyes beaming with a wide smile and my arms spread out like a conductor. Then he would trace his gaze down the stairs, along the wall, taking in my mural.

I’ll never forget his reaction. He came in peacefully as he usually did. He hung his key up. Then he reached for the light before flicking it on. I watched his eyes. Straight up to me, slowly down the wall. Back up to me again. And then, it came. A thunderous burst of laughter and happiness that rumbled through the house, illuminating it, even in near darkness. Mum had told me this is how she fell in love with him, but I had never witnessed it myself. Only a few people were lucky enough to see him like this.

“Ife, come downstairs right now!”, he roared between mouthfuls of laughter. By now, I was howling with laughter too. He presented himself with open arms as I reached the bottom stair. I leaped into them.

“Me too my daughter, me too”, he admitted.

My mum rushed in. “Nathan, ki lo de? What’s making you laugh like this?”, she enquired. With my small body still in his arms, he spun to face her. “Wait for it”, he whispered to me.

Immediately, her gaze flicked between the two of us and my work on the wall behind. Then her jaw dropped. My mum took on a new form that evening. She sparkled and fizzed like a shaken bottle of coke. Can one be angry and joyful at the same time? Somehow she achieved it. She embraced the two of us, her body heaving with laughter, but her mouth flowing with chastening. The scent of her perfume overcame my senses. Her embrace alternated between hugging us and squeezing the life out of us.

“You truly are your father’s daughter, Ife,” she said as she released her last fit of laughter. “And because of that, he will help you clean it up.” She looked at dad teasingly. “Oya, chop chop!”.

Although dad and I cleaned it up, it never fully went away.

You know, things were nice back then. But the universe does this thing where it chews you up and swishes you around. Some get swallowed, others learn how to harness its energy but most of us just get spat back out again. I was like most people. Cancer ripped the life out of dad which crushed mum who soon followed him. After that, life became a series of consecutive lows, interrupted by small reversals that would promise better times to come but invariably fail to produce them. That was how I found myself on the bridge by the high-street on a wet Tuesday morning. 18 long years after that fond night; ready to swallow my own life if the universe wouldn’t.
