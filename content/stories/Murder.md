Would you believe me if I told you I once killed a man?

Yes.

I saw him in the final stage, that mortal disease that overcame him like tidal waves. He smiled and danced this gleeful dance, but to me it looked like he writhed in pain. Sin followed him like a bridal train, he was headed to the alter. A celebration of wed to the untrained eye, a reservation with death that I just waved by.

My deadly silence, the kindest violence.

My hands are crimson red, and my heart looks like what you see when you close your eyelids.

I could have helped him but I laughed with him instead. Throaty roars emanating from the chamber of my chest. They were as toxic fumes to the young man, they went straight to his head. I should have spoke the truth that could save him instead.
