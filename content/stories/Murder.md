Would you believe me if I told you I once killed a man?  


I saw him in the final stage,
the mortal disease that overcame him like a tidal wave.
He smiled and danced this gleeful dance,
but to me it looked like he writhed in pain. 
Sin followed him like a bridal train - he was headed to the altar.

A celebration of wed to the untrained eye.
A reservation with death that I just waved by.

My deadly silence, the kindest violence.
We laughed in public, I wept in private.



I could have helped him but I laughed with him instead. Throaty roars emanating from the chamber of my chest. They were as toxic fumes to the young man, they went straight to his head. I should have spoke the truth that could save him instead.
