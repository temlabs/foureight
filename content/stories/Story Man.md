The night was cool, the roads were empty.
Not a ping from a phone, the chatter of tv heard at no home.

They sat before me, and I knew they were ready.
Tell me a story, well of course, I have many.

Stories of loss, and stories of gain.
Stories of pleasure, stories of pain.

Stories of treasure.
Look closely, it’s just beyond those hills.
Stories of gaping souls that can’t be filled.

Stories of hero’s, stories of villains.
Stories where the two aren’t so different.

Of Lies and of truths, stories of our roots.
Stories of the culture we brought forth as fruit.

Stories of family, stories of abandon,
Stories of friendships and how it’s a blessing to have them.

I have stories of intimacy, stories of trust.
And stories of missing someone you love.

Stories of freedom, of climbing, of falling.
Stories of birth and stories of mourning,

Stories of peace, stories of violence,
And staring out of the window in silence.

Through mountain tops, to lonely rock bottoms,
The rain still falls, the flowers still blossom.

Stories of men who built grand sandcastles.
The waves don’t remind us of who we are that often.

I know those stories we hide and guard with our lives,
Stories we’d never allow beyond the confines of our minds.

stories of faith, stories of despair.
Stories of hope, and breaking down in tears.

Stories of building up in times after,
Of being doubled over in laughter,
And joy flowing through places you believed to be dead.

You should smile more, you might surprise yourself.

Stories of sin, yet forgiveness is spilled.
Love and fear clink swords in the field.

Stories of God, and Jesus, and light.
Stories that tug at the fabric of life.

The story of men,
The story of man.

The words of a story man.
