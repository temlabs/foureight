“This isn’t going to work. It’s over”

“Bukky. Are you being for real? Are you breaking up with me?”, Abi asks.

She speaks in a concerned tone, similar to the one she would use on those hard days that ended with me withdrawing completely. On those days, she would long for access to my thoughts, access to me. And she usually got it. Truthfully, that voice could fizzle away the my most callous moods and cause me to surrender every burden to the authority of her warmth. But now, it sounds cold, contaminated with a mix of fear and contention. She knows these are the final minutes of our relationship, but her stubbornness won’t allow her to accept it that easily.

“Yes Abi, I am”, I reply. “Let’s be honest, this is going to keep on happening and I’m tired of feeling like a prisoner.”

“Bukky, I know, and I’m sorry. We can work through this. Have we not worked through everything? Kini o nso, ah ah!”

I pause. She is beginning to unravel. For a moment I am acutely aware of the pain I am inflicting on my best friend. I imagine how it feels. A sudden twisting of the stomach accompanied by a burst of heat behind the cheeks. A numbness that starts at the extremities before pressing inwards, like an army marching towards the heart. After a while I stop imagining. I don’t need to because I can feel it too. Am I wicked for this? Maybe I belong in a prison after all. No. It’s better this way. Some pains are necessary.

“Listen Abiola, your jealousy and insecurity are too much. They've practically crippled our relationship. This isn’t how it was before.". I pause. "A common cold can be worked through. A flu can be worked through. But you can’t work through AIDs. No. It destroys your only means of defence. How can a body destroy something that robs it of its ability to destroy in the first place? How can we work through the problem when the trust that’s required to do that _is_ the problem? I think you just need to spend some time alone and heal before you can be in a relationship. And that’s fine. Now just isn’t the right time.”

I’m a little taken aback at my razor-sharp delivery. I sound more severe than usual and this makes me uncomfortable. Abiola is stood on the other side of the room. Her form now resembles that of a migraine sufferer, eyes closed with hands on a tilted back head. A single tear rolls down her cheek and I’m immediately winded. The only thing between us is the double bed that we’d both chosen together a year ago. A platform upon which connections were established and comforts indulged now sits cold and idle, an impassable barrier between us that will never be crossed again.

“Abiola, I’m so-”

“Bukky, no…”

She sniffles and then, with an eruption of tears, she crashes to her knees at the side of the bed. Her delicate, yet anguished cries pierce my heart over and over. Inwardly, I pray that I’ll forget what they sound like one day. I circumvent the bed to her side and kneel beside her. It’s a peculiar thing to comfort someone you’ve hurt. To comfort someone usually means being able to take on their version of events. To sit with them on their side of reality and together, marvel at the misfortune they’ve been subject to. But to do this would be to marvel at the wickedness of my decision while staunchly refusing to renounce it. I don’t know what to do. So, I hug her. I hug with the firmest embrace I can muster up and tell her that everything will be okay. Her cocoa butter scented hair is even wetted by a few tears of my own.
