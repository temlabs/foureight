Everyone knows that one scene ðŸ˜‚

> My boy's wicked smart!

I watched Good Will Hunting alone one late night in my living room after everyone had gone to bed. I loved it.

I'd describe it as the story of a gifted boy who finally tells himself the truth. I suppose every great story has an element of this. The protagonist's view of himself, the truth about himself, and his lived experience finally agree, and the harmony is sweet. However, this film does it with charm, humour, romance and a boyish down-to-earth-ness that's hard to refuse.
