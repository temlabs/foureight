this is really rough. you know those times when you're looking for God but can't seem to find Him? i guess this is a song about that, about wandering, looking for him.
i don't have all the lyrics, most of the time i just press record and see what comes out, then write later and there's some of that here


lyrics

won't you meet in this sanctuary?
crying out Lord can you hear me
in a dry and thirsty land, my soul...
crying out Lord can you hear me?


days go by,
i lay low i,
can't lie you know hate those si-
lent moments when i don't hear you and we're worlds apart,
it's the same old life,
i'm living and you take your time,
but i've been learning how to wait on you and,
come bold on my own to the throne of grace no pride,
give me strength when my tank runs low i'm a bankrupt soul i could pay no mind,
times past, i would stand in place, never take no strides, to obtain no prize, i embraced those lies,
but a word from you is like-
apples of gold that my hands enclose-
an emerging bloom of light, I-
had some pain i was going in circles,
i took a blow like virgil (Abloh),
you Lord, you got them words eternal,
how could i ever desert you?
i wanna hear from the Spirit that search you,
then i wanna hide your word so deep...


I don't mind waiting...
