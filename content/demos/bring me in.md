On this particular afternoon, I didn't know what to say to God. So I just opened my mouth and started singing these words. Suddenly I knew He had come. I rushed this ugly recording shortly after because I wanted to remember this and come back to do it properly.

I have so much to say about music and the presence of God, and so many questions. I hope to write about it soon. I believe that the moment we open our mouths and focus on Him, and sing truly, He is right there with us.

Lyrics

When I lift up my song to you,
When I lift up my song to you,
I can feel myself coming closer,
To you.

Bring me in,
Bring me in,
Draw me Lord,
And I will run after you,
Bring me in
