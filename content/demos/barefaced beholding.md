who really knows you one hundred percent?
who knows your heart and who lets you undress?
if i was the sun it would always be cloudy
make sure no one knows a bad thing about me
i hid myself when i found sin inside me,
self hatred filled me, raging like thunder,
i dressed myself in the robes of a king,
but i wore inferiority right under

all of my life i have longed to connect,
to know and be known and not just pretend.
i’ve been in company and still been so lonely,
hiding my heart in case they don’t accept.
  
who could accompany the creator of company?
i used to hate that i’d never attain,
the standard my creator was demanding from me.
wretched and wicked, hope couldn’t touch me.

hiding myself, redesigning myself, 
finding myself and hate what i find. 
losing myself to survive with myself.
but practically dying cause i am myself.

i didn’t know his demands were a call,
to lean on the one who had fulfilled them all. 
that i wouldn’t have to attain by myself,
that i would be helped and hope would be dealt

barefaced beholding,

the one that would give up his own life if it meant that i’d get to know him.
i told him leave me alone take your hands me,
he told me won’t reject or abandon me
he let me show him my ugly self and he didn’t run from me, he loved me well.

He’s seeing all of me, He’s healing all of me,
i love His word i have nothing else

barefaced beholding, 

naked and cold till he comes,
nothing to hide cause i’m loved either way, and i don’t need to front,

i know to whom i belong
