good morning

it's a lot like abraham's nephew,
i give God the praise and say thank you,
i've been contemplating my next move,
i've got a lot to make i'll be dead soon,
i make lots of waves from my bedroom,
i've got lots to say if you'll let me,
like i was lost for days till i met you,
and if not for grace i'd be so far gone.
what conversation could express you?
i want to make them accept you,
but all i have these words,
i guess we'll see what this pen do.
dear God i pray that this gets through,
don't complicate it i beg you,
i mix word with faith and then get to,
spreading love and praying God rescues,
all of us from this life of sin,
from dawn to dusk we go out to get it,
all is just to survive and then-
do it all again.
that why i'm not blocking this light within in,
though sometimes it gets frightening,
we've been called to unite with Him,
and take to world where life begins

good morning,
it's good to see you
