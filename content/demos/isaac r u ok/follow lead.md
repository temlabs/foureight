This song samples uncle Kirk's 'Jesus is the Reason'. I was playing around, granularizing the acapella and wound up with this stuttering pattern that I really liked. The rest of the beat was built around it.

This is a rough demo recording (I promise I can hit those notes, you'll know what i'm talking about soon lmao) and it was super fun to record. The message really is just staying steadfast and being faithful until the very end.

lyrics time

(verse 1)
I think about the lows sometimes, still I've got faith in a GOD WHO SEES
And even if goes awry, I won't complain I'll just follow lead (these opening lines are my favourite)

(chorus)
If it's go, I'm on road,
If it's no,
I'm on froze until you speak.
I follow your lead

Bring me close, and I'll flow,
If it's ropes,
Still I won't withdraw I'll seek.
I follow your lead

(verse 2)
I pray you take control of my life,
Lord make me who you want me to be,
I want to give it all on this side,
Don't want to say I wish I had been,
All of the ways, I doubted, I counted,
All just to say you're true.
Forcing a way, around it but now it,
Just falls into place with you.

chorus


(verse 3)
Ten toes,
I'm on post,
I be down to be under your hold,
Lay it down I'ma give you control,
I'll be singing your praise till the day we come home,
As the days unfold,
It gets cold,
But can you dance here before we get old,
Can you answer the call and then go?
Yo I think we'll be fine if we always follow,
And I'm saying,
let's go,
Vamos,
I come around with a very next flow,
See my smile I'm a very blessed bloke,
And I'm on a next wave you can come and get soaked,
And I always get low,
Then post,
In the presence Lord of the hosts,
Not ashamed of the words that he spoke,
If we follow His lead, them ah never get close
Them uh watch the ting go
