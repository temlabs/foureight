this is an ep i'm kind of working on at the moment, i'll upload more tracks soon.

i started writing it a time in life where i really wasn't okay. but i was pushing on through life and trying to be. and i kept hearing, are you ok? are you happy? i tried really hard to hide it but i have eyes that always betray me.

anyway, during this time, i found myself encouraging myself a lot in God. and some of these tracks are reflections of that
