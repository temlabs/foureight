This is book is a personal all-time favourite. I have read it through a couple of times and still come back to it.

I began to spend time studying marriage when the following occurred to me:
1. I'd like to get married
2. I may not be as good as loving as I thought
3. Most of my thoughts and ideas on marriage are from culture, limited examples, and hear say
4. I have much to do by way of preparation

And so I picked this book up. But what I didn't know was that when I'd read it, not only would the weight of what marriage is be impressed upon me, but also the weight of God's love for us.

Tim Keller expertly dissects our cultures misappropriation of marriage, and sets the stage for an exploration of this great mystery. God and church, man and woman.

The title is somewhat unfortunate. This isn't a book on marriage as much as it is a book on Christianity full stop. This book will make you a better lover and transform all of your relationships, because it will make you a better _Christian_. 

And how you ask? By taking us back to the one who first loved us.
