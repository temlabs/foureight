Till We Have Faces is the lynchpin of one of my life's biggest fascinations - the issue of self-deception, and how it stops us from seeing God. This book brings home this idea that God will not deal with us until we have faces, that is, we stop hiding. Perhaps it is better worded like this, We can only see God to the extent that we ourselves are unveiled.

This wonderfully written retelling of the story of Psyche and Cupid might be my favourite book of all time and its effect still ripple through my life today.

It was Lewis's favourite of all of his work. I understand why.
