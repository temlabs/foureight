Till We Have Faces is the lynchpin of one of my life's biggest fascinations - the issue of self-deception. It might be my favourite book of all time and the story still ripples through my life today.

It's a retelling of the story of Psyche and Cupid and was Lewis's favourite work. I understand why.
