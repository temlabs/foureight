Wendy Alec takes us on a journey through a world before mankind and details the crippling fall of the morning star, Lucifer. When I first start reading it, I felt her language to be overly descriptive. But not before long, I realized that it needed to be to capture the heights and the depths of the world in which this is set requires it. I devoured the book in just a couple of days.

Alec seems to lift you up into another world, and breathes life into the mystery of the world and the operation of God before man.

Apart from the heart wrenching story, what I love most about the book is the picture of Lucifer's psyche that Alec lays out. It's a cautionary tale that comes with important reminders.
