In 2020, this book outright changed my life and the wisdom contained is necessary for everyone.

> For two years I kept hearing an inner voice saying, "Everything you need or want is already in your life - merely awaiting your recognition of it."

Murdock explains what you need to recognize in life, and how to recognize. It's perhaps the greatest tragedy to find out too late that you had something great. For every season of life, a book like this is the antidote.
