This book is an _adventure_. It sucks you in. When you put it down, the effect is both devastating and gracious. On one hand, you're back in your pale, drab life. On the other hand, a fire which roars "With God, anything is possible" sends sparks up from the depths of your heart.

Bonnke was a man swallowed by compassion for the lost and it is infectious. Perhaps my favourite aspect of the book is how he relates with the Holy Spirit. It's absolutely illuminating. What God can do with someone who is fully yielded! This book has been an asset for my personal walk with God, and my ministry.

On top of that, it's marvellously written.
