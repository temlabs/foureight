What happens at the extremes of the human experience? I picked up this book because growing up in a comfortable middle class setting as I have shelters one from the realities of life in a way. I may never suffer this aspect of life, and who knows what truths are lost out on as a result?

On the negative side of this spectrum of extremes, I don't know if we have better documented examples as the Holocaust. in the first part of the book, Frankl walks the reader through his experience at camp with particular emphasis on how one's thoughts and mind change in such extremes. In part 2 which at the time of writing, I have not yet reached, he explores 'Logotherapy' and his ideas about finding meaning in life.
