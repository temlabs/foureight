Pensées (literally 'thoughts') in french is a collection of thoughts from Blaise Pascal, a French Christian philosopher from the 1600s. It's from here we get the famous 'Pascal's Wager'. I enjoy many of the ideas Pascal charts out here. As you read, you get the sense that Pascal was someone intimate with and acutely aware of the 'bigness' of God as it pertains to the every day life of man under the sun.

I wonder if Pascal and Solomon would have much to discuss. Pensées shares the spirit of Ecclesiastes. They differ in that Pensées is not instructive. It's only Pascal's observation and explanation of the world.
