This is one of my favourite books of _all time_ and I haven't even finished it. It has been revolutionizing the way I approach conversation and the way I see people.

Everything you need for your life right now is bundled up in some person somewhere, a mere conversation away. Often though, our conversations often have the effect of closing people off, rather than drawing out their merchandise. And *everyone* is full of merchandise.

This book tackles, on a heart level, the assumptions we make about ourselves and others that shut us off from the gold hidden inside people, instead of surfacing it.

- Keep the knowledge of your ignorance as near as your shadow.
- Resist the urge to tell, and reach for an ask.

In short, it's a masterclass on soliciting and delivering information. And I think it's a must read for anyone serious about improving their relationships with people whether at home or the workplace.
