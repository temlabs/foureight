This is one of my favourite books of _all time_ and I haven't even finished it. It's been revolutionizing the way I approach conversation and the way I see people since the day I picked it up.

Everything you need for your life right now is bundled up in some person somewhere. It's only a  conversation away. This book tackles, on a heart level, the assumptions we make that push back the gold hidden inside people instead of surfacing it.

It's a masterclass on both soliciting and delivering information, and therefore, working and living with people. I think it's a must read for anyone interested in improving their relationships whether at home or the workplace.
