I stopped dead in my tracks when I read those words for the first time.  

> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  
> **Proverbs 8:1**

Life at the time felt like an unending blooper reel. I wasn't enjoying it. You see, I was experiencing the worst kind of hardship, the type that you've created for yourself. My foolishness was tattooed on the inside of my eyelids. Every time I closed my eyes to escape the hardship without, I was presented with a vivid reminded of who caused it. I couldn't escape.

And so It comforted me to read these words. It was like the distant sound of a helicopter in the ears of one stuck on a deserted island. My foolishness was the island, but help had come - I could escape it. To know that wisdom was crying out, looking for me and that she *wanted* to be found was great respite.

> Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of man.  
> **Proverbs 8:4**

> And my delights were with the sons of men.  
> **Proverbs 8:31**

The voice and the joy of wisdom is to us and in us respectively, the sons (and daughters) of men.  

Her cry captured my intrigue. I had no relation to her but If she wanted to be by me, then I wouldn't ignore her. I suppose everyone loves wisdom eventually. But eventually is too late. I decided that I wouldn't be among those who valued her too late. I sought to make her my affection, to be attentive to her, and to value her. And I wanted her to love me also.

> I love them that love me;  
> **Proverbs 8:17**

> All they that hate me love death.  
> **Proverbs 8:36**

> Because I have called, and ye refused;
> I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;  
> **Proverbs 1:24**

> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,  
> And be filled with their own devices.  
> **Proverbs 1:31**

She began to talk to me about work. And how she was there at the beginning of creation, accompanying, strengthening, instructing, counselling, rejoicing. It's in her nature to create, to enliven and to bring into order. Wisdom rejoices in her work because it is always good. It's why she delights in you and I. We are God's great workmanship, better than fine gold.  

> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way,
> *Before* his works of old.  
> **Proverbs 8:22**

She explained that I ought to look for her first, before doing anything. And that I'd always find her at the beginning, that this was how to enjoy work. And I did find her at the beginning. There she would be waiting for me, with many words. When I went out, they lead me. When I slept, they kept me. And during my waking ours, they were on my lips and in my ears.

> Wisdom is the principal \[first] thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding  
> **Proverbs 4:7**

> And those that seek me early shall find me.  
> **Proverbs 8:17**

She explained that so long as I sought her, my lineage of errors could be a lineage of treasure. She is on my side.  

Doth not wisdom cry out? Indeed she does. And I have found nothing better, than to answer her.
