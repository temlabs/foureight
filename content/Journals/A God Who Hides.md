> “Let them at least learn what is the religion they attack, before attacking it. If this religion boasted of having a clear view of God, and of possessing it open and unveiled, it would be attacking it to say that we see nothing in the world which shows it with this clearness. But since, on the contrary, it says that men are in darkness and estranged from God, that He has hidden Himself from their knowledge, that this is in fact the name which He gives Himself in the Scriptures, Deus absconditus;”  
> **[[Pensees|Pensées 194]]**

Christianity has never claimed to have all answers, and a perfect knowledge of God. Quite the opposite in fact. I suppose this is one of the greatest frustrations of men. 

"God, if you are real, then show yourself unmistakably. Then I'd believe."

But alas:

> Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.  
> **Isaiah 45:15**

## I won't Get into why God hides Himself

(The same reasons you hide yourself.)
Why doesn't everyone know you intimately?
Why doesn't everyone know your secrets?
Why doesn't everyone have unrestricted to your precious things?

But I won't get into all of that here, except to say this:

> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.  
> **Matthew 5:8**

And this:

> If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me.  
> **Jeremiah 29:13**

The natural man does not have the tools to see God. [[Till We Have Faces]] is a book that explores this well and I couldn't recommend it enough.

I'd like to talk about this in more detail in another post.

What I want to do here however, is tell you is that you can know God more, and that it's a worthwhile journey- the most important of your life in fact.

## We will never know Him fully on this side of life

> For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.  
> **1 Corinthians 13:12**

God promises that one day, things will be made perfect, including our knowledge of Him. God knows us through and through, and one day the fogginess of our mired mortality will give way to a clear day. Like the angels, we too will exist in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory. We will see Him clearly.

But for now, we only know God in part, and speak about Him in part.
## God wants you to know Him

And it's not that God doesn't want to show Himself to you - He does. The bible tells us that in fact, eternal life which God sent His son to give us is exactly that - knowing Him.

> And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.  
> **John 17:3**

This is significant because we aren't entitled to knowing Him. At any point in time, you control the extent to which people know you and have access to you. When that right is taken from you, you feel violated. No one has a right to know you. So why do we approach God with this entitlement? If He decides to leave us to our own devices, and never show Himself again, it is His prerogative. But I am grateful that He doesn't.

## How does God bear Himself?

### First, by Giving us grace

Rather, God invites us to know Him and He does so by first by giving us grace. Jesus Christ is called the revelation of God's grace.

> [!info]**grace** 
> /ɡreɪs/ *noun*  
> the free and unmerited favour of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings.

 > but \[grace of God] has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel  
 > **1 Timothy:10

In Jesus, the common man receives the blessing, ability and right to know God. He doesn't deserve it, but through faith, He is given the tools and the right to start relating with God on this side of eternity.

### Then, by leading us along The Way

Jesus describes Himself as “The Way”, that is the route, or path to eternal life, and to God Himself. See what this verse in Proverbs tells us.

> But the path of the just is like the shining sun, that shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.”  
> **Proverbs 4:18**

Can you see how it tugs on the same thread as [[#We will never know Him fully on this side of life|1 Corinthians 13:12]]?

Jesus is the path of the just.

When a man receives Jesus, His spirit (the part that can relate with God) is renewed. Amidst the circus of life, He begins to catch glimpses of God moving in it all. And at times, moving within himself. These moments go as quickly as they come but they're unmistakable. With time, he begins to understand in part what God is up to, and even where to find Him. Not before long he communicates with God. And to His shock, God hears and speaks back. Gently, in a still small voice. He tunes his ear towards it.

This is what knowing God looks like. Gradually. As the days in Him go on, we see dimly but ever clearer.

## Dimness is no reason to withdraw

Many have absconded from the search for God because initially, it seems too dim, too intangible, and too high to get a hold of. But educated people were not born educated, nor athletes fit and in top condition. Everyone must start life in the dark and with the dimmest of views. 

Maybe we don't believe it is possible to know God. If we were assured that the journey had an expected end, in the same way that a university course does, then we might pursue. But since we are not sure, we would prefer not to waste our little time.

But I want to tell you that not only is it possible to know God, it is His *promise* to **you**.

God's hiddenness is not a barrier, but a bridge to go deeper. Although in our present circumstance, we find ourselves in the shadow of eternity; one day, we will behold the one who loved us first, with bare face, in the fullness of the day.
