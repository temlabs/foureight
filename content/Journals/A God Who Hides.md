> “Let them at least learn what is the religion they attack, before attacking it. If this religion boasted of having a clear view of God, and of possessing it open and unveiled, it would be attacking it to say that we see nothing in the world which shows it with this clearness. But since, on the contrary, it says that men are in darkness and estranged from God, that He has hidden Himself from their knowledge, that this is in fact the name which He gives Himself in the Scriptures, Deus absconditus;”  
> **[[Pensees|Pensées 194]]**

Christianity has never boasted a perfect knowledge of God. Quite the opposite in fact.

> Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.  
> **Isaiah 45:15**

While the God in the bible is described as quintessentially hidden, it is not for aloofness or for a desire to frustrate us. Actually, He wants to lead us into all truth, and will do the moment we allow Him to. I’d love to write about why God is by default hidden to us, and who we have to become in order see Him, but that’s  for another post. (In the meantime, [[Till We Have Faces]] is a book that explores this well and I couldn't recommend it enough.)

In this post, I simply want to impress upon you that God can be known, and that knowing God is the most important journey of your life.


## We will never know Him fully on this side of life

First, we have to accept an essential truth about our existence in this life. Our knowledge of God, here below, will always be partial.

> For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.  
> **1 Corinthians 13:12**

God promises that one day, things will be made perfect, including our knowledge of Him. One day the haziness of this life will give way to the clearness of day. Like the angels, we too will exist in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory. We will see Him as He really is. It will be awesome and fearful.

For now though, we only know God in part, and can only speak about Him in part.  


## God wants you to know Him

It’s not that God doesn't want to show Himself to you in this life - He does. The bible tells us that in fact, eternal life, which God sent His son to give us, is exactly that - knowing Him.

> And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.  
> **John 17:3**

And for the Christian, eternal life begins on the day of his conversion.

That God would have us know Him is no small thing. No one is entitled to know anyone, how much more God? When you are known against your wishes, doesn’t it feel like a violation of sorts? Isn’t privacy your right? It’s a *privilege* to know someone, and the height of all privileges to know God. If He decided to leave a people that rejected Him to their own devices, and never show Himself again, it would be His prerogative. 

I am so grateful that He doesn’t didn’t.

## How does God bear Himself?

So, if God wishes to bear Himself to us, how does He do it?
### First, by Giving us grace

God invites us to know Him first by giving us grace. Jesus Christ is called the revelation of God's grace.

> [!info]**grace** 
> /ɡreɪs/ *noun*  
> the free and unmerited favour of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings.

 > but \[the grace of God] has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel  
 > **1 Timothy:10

In Jesus, the common man receives the blessing, ability and right to know God. He doesn't deserve it, but through faith, He is given the tools and the legal right to start relating with God on this side of eternity.

### Then, by leading us along The Way

Jesus describes Himself as “The Way”, that is the route, or path to eternal life, and to God Himself. See what this verse in Proverbs tells us.

> But the path of the just is like the shining sun, that shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.”  
> **Proverbs 4:18**

Can you see how it tugs on the same thread as [[#We will never know Him fully on this side of life|1 Corinthians 13:12]]?

Jesus is the path of the just.

When a man receives Jesus, His spirit (the part that can relate with God) is renewed. Amidst the hurried scenes of life, He begins to catch glimpses of God moving in it all. And at times, moving within himself. These moments go as quickly as they come but they're unmistakable. With time, he begins to understand in part what God is up to, and even where to find Him. Not before long he communicates with God. And to His shock, God hears and speaks back. Gently, in a still small voice. He tunes his ear towards it.

This is what knowing God looks like. It happens gradually. As the days spent in Him go on, we all see dimly but ever clearer.

## Dimness is no reason to withdraw

Many withdraw from the pursuit of God because initially, it seems too uncertain, too intangible, and too high to get a hold of. But doctors were not born with the knowledge of medicine, nor lawyers with the knowledge of law. Everyone starts life in the dim valley of ignorance. In many areas, we spend our entire lives clawing ourselves out.

So why not apply the same to God? Maybe it’s because we don't believe it’s possible to know Him. If we were assured that the journey had an expected end, in the same way that a university course does, for instance, then we might pursue. But since we are not sure, we prefer not to waste our little time.

But I want to impress upon you that not only is it possible to know God, it is His *promise* to **you**.

God's hiddenness is not a barrier, but an invitation. Like lovers discovering themselves under the canopy of a promise kept, God invites us to discover Him. And although in our present circumstance, we find ourselves in the dim shadow of eternity, one day, it will be as waking up from a blurry dream you remember nothing about; or wearing glasses for the first time. One day, we will behold the one who loved us first, with bare face, in the fullness of the day.

> This was so that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grasp for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.  
> **Acts 17:27**
