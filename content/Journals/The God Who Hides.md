Inspiration

I read this in Blaise Pascals ‘Pensées’ (thoughts). He was a mathematician and Christian philosopher in France, around the 1600s. Here’s what he said about attackers of Christianity.

_“Let them at least learn what is the religion they attack, before attacking it. If this religion boasted of having a clear view of God, and of possessing it open and unveiled, it would be attacking it to say that we see nothing in the world which shows it with this clearness. But since, on the contrary, it says that men are in darkness and estranged from God, that He has hidden Himself from their knowledge, that this is in fact the name which He gives Himself in the Scriptures, Deus absconditus;”_

**Pensées 194**

And it dawned on me afresh that we have absolutely no right to know God, neither do we even have the facilities to comprehend Him. That part of us (our Spirit, or inner man) is originally dead because of sin, which begets death.

_“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”_

**Romans 6:23**

_“..and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.”_

**James 1:15**

Also, Satan himself has made it his mission to numb us, blind us and warp our perception of the light of Christ.

_“In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”_

**2 Corinthians 4:4**

People often hurl their frustration at a hidden God, saying, “Why don’t you just show yourself unmistakeable, then we’d all believe”. But God has no reason or obligation to make Himself manifest in fleshly (or even spiritual) terms to us. But He has made Himself manifest in the flesh through when The Word become flesh, and ultimately in the dispensation of His Holy Spirit- because He loves us.

_“who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began, but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,”_

**2 Timothy 1:9-10**

_“And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.”_

**John 17:3**

God delights in our spirituality because we are spirit before all else which means we can be close to Him and know Him. But even the most spiritual of us are seeing dimly, and will continue to try and piece together blurry, fragmented images of God.

_“For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.”_

**1 Corinthians 13:12**

You see that? We are promised that one day, we will know, we will see and understand in all fullness and clarity. We will be free from corruption and we will be able to take God in properly. You know when you put on glasses for the first time? Like that x999999.

Jesus describes Himself as “The Way”, that is a route, or path. He has run his race (Hebrews 12), and now we follow this author of our faith. He is the path, and He shows us this path. Proverbs 4:18 says this:

_“But the path of the just is like the shining sun, that shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.”_

**Proverbs 4:18**

And we should expect nothing less as Christians. It’s God’s desire that we know Him and the one whom He sent. He wants us to see The Way and so it grows ever clearer as we follow Him, walking by faith, step by step. Confusion and darkness become a foreign concept as we learn to be led by The Spirit and know The Word.

 _“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”_

**Psalm 119:105**

Christianity is a journey of coming to knowledge of the unknowable, searching the unsearchable and becoming that which we have never ought to have imagined in our wildest dreams becoming, by the grace of Jesus Christ.

_“If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me. “_

**Jeremiah 29:13**

Man is born with a hard task, with a journey to embark on. I can tell you for a fact that it is not easy! God knows it Himself. But it is a worthy pursuit and a worthy cause. It is foolishness to ignore it altogether, and wisdom to search out this Truth. God will honour those who earnestly seek.

The Video

The camera is observing through something like panes of frosted glass, with varying transparency. The camera adopts a POV style, so that the viewer is the one embarking on a journey. We get the impression that our person is looking for something, searching, as we all are. Things seem to be happening around, distractions, delusions that compel us and convince us all alike.

As time goes on, things appear to get clearer, such that some things we thought to be “x” from the other side of the glass were not really as they seemed, where some others were.

At some point we catch a clear glimpse of that figure, between two different panes, or a even a crack in the glass. It’s clear as day, unmistakeable, our Spirits have been quickened for a moment in time and we get a sense of something beyond us, above us, something more. Unbeknownst to us, we have met The Holy Spirit, He has brushed shoulders with us. But it’s over all too quickly, as quickly as we saw that graceful figure, he/she has disappeared from sight and once again we are lost, in confusion. It was unmistakeable, but it was short enough to make us wonder, was it real?

But even though we questioned, we know that our deepest longing has been answered, and we have been set off into a fervent pursuit of God Himself. Man, running after God. We have to experience Him again and we won’t stop until we can stay in that moment, until we can sit there in His glory as time stretches out into forever.

So, the camera now moves with more intensity, a hunger has been ignited. We move between more panes, more shades if confusion. We catch another glimpse. This time we are assured it is for real and not some subtle working of our imagination. And we seem to have an inkling of how to find it again. At this point, we are being led. And so, the apparitions grow more frequently, we enjoy longer glimpses of the figure. He/she is beautiful with kindest features, draped in gold (or white) garments. He/she moves so gracefully. The figure seems to call you into the same motion. We try but it doesn’t look so good on us- we almost fall over. Ah! Lost Him again. But wait, there He is, found Him!

This continues. All around us, the confusion and muddy ness is reducing, the panes if glass that we look through are not as blurry. The moments of clarity we get as we move between them lasts longer. We are seeing Him, beholding Him unveiled. The music has lightened and sounds as beautiful as He is at this point.

Suddenly, we find ourselves close enough to touch. The hand of the figure is outstretched, welcoming us into an embrace. With great apprehension, we reciprocate. Contact is just established when the screen goes cuts to black and the video ends. The viewer is left with impression that of all the things to search for, they sought after the greatest thing; that it was all worth it; That they were on the threshold of that perfect day.
