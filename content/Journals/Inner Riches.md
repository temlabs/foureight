When detailing his experience in a concentration camp, Victor Frankl wrote:

Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain (they were often of a delicate constitution), but the damage to their inner selves was less. They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom. Only in this way can one explain the apparent paradox that some prisoners of a less hardy makeup often seemed to survive camp life better than did those of a robust nature."

The paradox Frankl speaks of seems to hint that life is sustained by immaterial things just as much as the material. In times of extreme suffering and loss, we have no choice but to look inwardly for resources -after all, these are the things that no one can take away. But imagine the hopelessness of turning inward during calamity and finding only emptiness and vanity. On this count, it's worth taking the trouble to furnish our soul with things that can sustain us during extreme trials that can befall us at any moment.

I'm reminded of Jesus's answer to Satan in the wilderness. Hungry and weary at the end 40 day fast, Satan asks Him, as the son of God, to turn stones to bread.  

> But he answered and said, "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."

Jesus is explaining that there is another sustenance by which He could survive in the wilderness for 40 days and 40 nights. One that Satan hoped He didn't know about.

In moments of physical hardship, this alternate sustenance carries a deeper significance. But because modern life is mostly free of physical hardship (except we deliberately induce it), we may never have a clue about our level of inward nourishment, until we find ourselves in situations that bring our inner man to bear. And by this time, it's too late to do much about it.

So this is a reminder to take the discipline of eating this kind of food as seriously as the discipline of eating physical food. The feeding of the soul and spirit is preparation for times where strength of soul and spirit matter more than anything else. And since no generation has been exempt from such times, we shouldn't expect to be either.
