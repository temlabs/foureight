When detailing his experience in a concentration camp, Victor Frankl wrote:

> "In spite of all the enforced physical and mental primitiveness of the life in a concentration camp, it was possible for spiritual life to deepen. Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain (they were often of a delicate constitution), but the damage to their inner selves was less. They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom. Only in this way can one explain the apparent paradox that some prisoners of a less hardy makeup often seemed to survive camp life better than did those of a robust nature."

The paradox Frankl speaks of seems to show that life is sustained by immaterial things just as much as the material. In times of extreme suffering and loss, we have no choice but to look inwardly for resources. After all, these are the things that no one can take away. But imagine the despair and horror of looking inside in calamity and finding only emptiness and vanity. On this count, it's worth taking the trouble to furnish your soul with things that enable us to whether the extreme trials that may befall us at any point in time.

I'm reminded of Jesus's answer here:

> But he answered and said, "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
> **Matthew 4:4**

Jesus is explaining that there is another sustenance by which He could survive in the wilderness for 40 days and 40 nights. One that Satan hoped He didn't know about.

In moments of physical hardship, this alternate sustenance carries a deeper significance. But because modern life is mostly free of physical hardship (except we deliberately induce it), it's easy to see how it can be neglected.

So this is a reminder to take the discipline of eating this kind of food as seriously as the discipline of eating physical food.
