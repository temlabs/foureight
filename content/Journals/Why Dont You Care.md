It wasn't long ago that my friend received an eviction notice. In 3 months, he would need to be out of the property with keys returned and the property restored to its initial state. The date of this deadline had been issued, and already the landlord was making arrangements for the next stage of this property's life.

Naturally, I queried- "What next?"

And naturally, he responded by telling me he had been scouring the web for a new place. He even asked if I knew of any sites he may not have already considered. After all, the risk of homelessness was looming.

Imagine if instead he had replied with, "I don't know, we'll see. I'm not really thinking about that right now". At t-minus 3 months, you might forgive him. At t-minus 2 months, you'd raise an eyebrow. At t-minus 1 month, you'd consider him extremely irresponsible. Or wonder if he owned a secret property somewhere else.

It would be even stranger still, if for the duration of the notice period, he occupied himself with matters of interior deco- whether he should buy this lamp or that. Or whether the tulips he had  planted in the garden would finally bloom this time or stay in the ground like the previous year.

Probably you wouldn't have much sympathy if he ended up homeless.

This is a fictional story and I tell it because we aren't so different to this desperate fellow.

Much of our energy and time is spent on issues of relative insignificance. We study tirelessly to predict the price of an asset. Experts on the news fret over which way the next geopolitical winds will blow. We deliberate over whether we should take a new job or stay put, or whether he/she will love us back.

All the while, we neglect to prepare for the one undeniable, 100% certain thing that all can agree on. That somewhere in the distance, at the end of the conveyor belt we are presently being moved along, death licks his lips and rubs two eager hands together, anticipating our arrival. One day, it will swallow us all.

This observation was particularly harrowing to Blaise Pascal, who remarked:

> "Nothing is so important to man as his own state, nothing is so formidable to him as eternity; and thus, it is not natural that there should be men indifferent to the loss of their existence, and to the perils of everlasting suffering. They are quite different with regard to all other things. They are afraid of mere trifles; they foresee them; they feel them. And this same man who spends so many days and nights in rage and despair for the loss of office, or for some imaginary insult to his honour, is the very one who knows without anxiety and without emotion that he will lose all by death. It is a monstrous thing to see in the same heart and at the same time this sensibility to trifles and this strange insensibility to the greatest objects. It is an incomprehensible enchantment, and a supernatural slumber, which indicates as its cause an all-powerful force."  
> **Blaise Pascal in [[Pensees|Pens√©es]]

It seemed to Pascal that the most pressing issue on the mind of every man under the sun ought to be this- "After death, then what?".

But it isn't. Exploring a topic like this is a huge undertaking, far beyond my remit, but I want to relate some thoughts on it and explore what the bible says about our indifference to death.

## We Can't Know What's Beyond

Some posit that since no one can truly know what happens after death, there's no point in doting over heaven or hell, or purgatory or whatever else any other ancient text claims as our fate. Better to focus on material things, and hope for the best.

I take issue with this argument for two reasons:

1) The fact that something can not be completely known does not absolve us of the duty to apprehend it.
2) We can develop strong justifications of heaven and hell with the tools we have.

### It's Worth Trying to Know the Unknowable

If you asked a researcher whether he/she thought everything could be known, they would likely say no. To claim that everything could be known, we'd need to also know the extent, or the shape of everything. And we'd also need to know whether the extent to which we have the capacity to know everything. As far as I know, neither are known.

But your researcher friend still finds his/her work worthwhile. And it is! Much good has been brought into the world because of it. Likewise, I reason that thinking of after death is as worthwhile an activity as they get.

The bible makes it clear that [[A God Who Hides#We will never know Him fully on this side of life|some things will never be fully known on this side of life]]. And yet, it seems God still wants us to seek:

## It's Much Too Heavy

The only other option is to bludgeon your conscience to death with lies. It's the equivalent of being fast asleep, having the lights suddenly flicked on, seeing the horrible state of your circumstance and proceeding to smash all the light bulbs. What this person needs to know is that their situation is not irredeemable at all. And that although they must by all means lose some things, they stand to gain infinitely more.
