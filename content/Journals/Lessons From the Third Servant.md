Matthew 25:14-30 is home to one of Jesus’s greatest stories - the parable of the talents. It goes like this: A nobleman travels afar and leaves his servants money, each according to his ability. One gets 5, another 2, and another 1. The first two use their gifts to generate commensurate returns. The recipient of the single talent however is afraid and hides his such that no gain is made and no loss is either. The nobleman returns and asks his servant to give account.

To the first two, he remarks,

>His lord said unto him, ﻿Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
>**Matthew 25:23**  

But to the third,

> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and ﻿slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed
> **Matthew 25:26**  


I have long been fascinated by this parable, which I encourage you to read. Not only because the topic of faithfulness is so dear to me, or because of the great principle of the story, commonly referred to as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect|Matthew Effect]] but because the lord’s responses just aren’t symmetrical. 

I expect the third servant to be called wicked, after all the first two are called good. But slothful? What does laziness have to do with unfaithfulness, or diligence with faithfulness? Even now, I don’t think I fully understand, but I’d like to take a moment to share my thoughts.

It turns out that the bible has a lot to say about faith and work.

> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith ﻿without thy works, and I will ﻿shew thee ﻿my faith by my works.
> **James 2:18** 

> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall ﻿after the same ﻿example of ﻿﻿unbelief.
> **Hebrews 4:11**  


## We Work According to Our Beliefs

Hebrews 4:11 equates failing to labour as an example of unbelief. James 2:18 show us that there is no separating what we believe from the work we do. I raised my curiosity about this topic with a friend. He remarked:

> “How hard would you work if you were 100% confident that \[through your work and to the extent of your work] you would achieve the end goal?”

And it’s a question worth thinking about. The gap between our answer and our reality is our lack of faith, or our disinterest in that end goal. In ‘The Art of Diligence’,  Mariam Nurudeen writes,

> By investing a lot, diligent individuals expect to gain a lot. They realize that what they get out of something depends upon what they are willing to put into it.
> **[[The Art of Diligence|Mariam Baaku Nurudeem, The Art of Diligence]]**

This was the difference between the first two servants and the third. The third one was afraid. He expected the worst outcome, the one in which he would be subject to the wrath of his master. What he couldn’t conceive however, was another outcome in which he worked, and the work yielded much, to the joy of his master.

> In all labour there is profit:
> **Proverbs 14:23 \[a]**  

This is the faith that moves the diligent. That my work is not in vain. That it will return a profit. They work because they believe it will deliver the best outcome. 

When we can’t bring ourselves to believe this, we necessarily become lazy. Lazy people don’t believe in the reward for work. And if there’s no reward or the reward is not worth much, then why bother at all? We ought rather to give up. And since we can’t see a reward but life by all means eventually asks us to give account of our use *and* makes us aware of the punishment, we adopt a scarcity mindset and incline ourselves to hiding and self-preservation. One of the ways lazy people do this is by blaming and making excuses to make themselves unaccountable.

>﻿The slothful man saith, There is ﻿a lion in the way;
>﻿A lion is in the streets.
>﻿**Proverbs 26:13**  

## There is No Laziness in Love and Faithfulness

The third servant was ultimately unfaithful to his master. His actions said,  

“I would rather protect myself than take a risk for you. Making you happy is second to ensuring there’s no skin off my back”.  

In this way, lazy people are necessarily unfaithful to the people who invest in them. 

>As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
>So is the sluggard to them that send him.
>**Proverbs 10:26**  

You can spot a person who is faithful to you like this. They value the things you entrust them with enough to make gain with them and they see you as someone worth making gain for. They want to ‘enter your joy’.

You get the feeling that the master would have been more pleased if the third servant had attempted to generate a return on the line talent and failed. He may even have given him another talent with which to try again. After all, it was according to his (clearly limited) ability that the master had distributed the lone talent at first. But what he couldn’t stand and found most deplorable was having no faith at all.

People who have faith, ‘work like they believe it’. And perhaps the best demonstration of your faithfulness and love to someone is seeing the best outcome given what they have placed in your trust, and working diligently to obtain it.

> \[love] believeth all things, hopeth all things, ﻿endureth all things.
> **1 Corinthians 13:7**  


These are my thoughts for now but I’m sure I will have more later. Faithfulness does not come naturally to me - let me tell you! But I’ve come to despise unfaithfulness, especially in myself. In the parable, God is the master and we are His servants to who He has entrusted as stewards. With money, with time, with energy, and with everything that has been given to us. Imagine the joy we would enter, if we were faithful with it all.
