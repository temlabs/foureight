>For we must needs die, and are as ﻿water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; ﻿neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he ﻿devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
>**2 Samuel 14:14** 


Only 3 chapters in Genesis are given to addressing the original ‘fall of man’. in fact, from the twelfth chapter of Genesis, God is already devising and spinning His great plan of redemption into action, starting with Abram. Not a second is wasted.

I think this shows us something of the heart of God. The biblical narrative, and I dare say the very mind of God, is desperately bent towards our deliverance and redemption, NOT our failures.

If anyone ever asks what the mind of God is, or what the biblical narrative is, you could tell them this: “Yet doth He devise means, that His banished be not expelled from Him”.
