## Introduction

Okay so, I read this quote not too long ago.

> "Nothing is so important to man as his own state, nothing is so formidable to him as eternity; and thus, it is not natural that there should be men indifferent to the loss of their existence, and to the perils of everlasting suffering. They are quite different with regard to all other things. They are afraid of mere trifles; they foresee them; they feel them. And this same man who spends so many days and nights in rage and despair for the loss of office, or for some imaginary insult to his honour, is the very one who knows without anxiety and without emotion that he will lose all by death. It is a monstrous thing to see in the same heart and at the same time this sensibility to trifles and this strange insensibility to the greatest objects. It is an incomprehensible enchantment, and a supernatural slumber, which indicates as its cause an all-powerful force."  
> **Blaise Pascal in [[Pensees|PensÃ©es]]

Somewhere in the distance, at the end of the conveyor belt we are presently being moved along, death licks his lips and rubs two eager hands together, anticipating our arrival. It seemed to Pascal that this fact, the only thing we know for certain, ought to be the most important thing in our collective psyche.

And I agree with him. But I need to draw a line between death and eternity. Because many use the fact of death alone, to guide their lives. They say things like:
"Let's eat and drink for tomorrow we die."
"Let's try and do maximum good in our lifetimes for the next generation. After all, tomorrow we die."
"Nothing really matters anyway, for tomorrow we die."
"Let's do whatever we want, for tomorrow we die"
The list goes on, and in fact, just about anything can be justified since 'tomorrow we die'.

Living in view of eternity is different. And few venture this far. If we don't simply just die, we're forced to ask questions about what kind of existence we might enjoy (or despise) after death, and how our present actions might determine that. For most of us, we only want to live forever if we don't have to die first.

I'm by no means the most qualified to talk about life in view of eternity, but having spoken to quite a few people on it, here are three reasons I find people opt to blind themselves to the possibility of eternal life.

## We Can't Know What's Beyond

Some posit that since no one can truly know what happens after death, there's no point in doting over heaven or hell, or purgatory or whatever else any other ancient text claims as our fate. Better to focus on material things, and then just hope for the best.

I take issue with this position for two reasons:

1) The fact that something can not be completely known does not absolve us of the duty to apprehend it.
2) We can develop strong justifications of heaven and hell even with the tools we have.

### It's Worth Trying to Know the Unknowable

If you asked a researcher whether he/she thought everything could be known, they would likely say no. To claim that everything could be known, we'd need to also know the extent, or the shape of everything. And we'd also need to know the extent to which we have the capacity to know everything. As far as I know, neither are known.

But your researcher friend still finds his/her work worthwhile. And it is! Much good has been brought into the world because of it. Likewise, I reason that thinking of after death is as worthwhile an activity as they get.

The bible makes it clear that [[A God Who Hides#We will never know Him fully on this side of life|some things will never be fully known on this side of life]]. And yet, it seems God still wants us to seek and think on them.

### There Are Compelling Justifications for Eternity
Thinking alone about the possibility of an eternal life affected by this one raises compelling justifications for the necessity of eternal life. While I won't expound on them here, most start from this preposition: If there is no enduring consequence, and therefore no external law, we are left with no real reason for anything and therefore no meaning, and we have to try and decide what's right and wrong on our own. It's hard to live as though the former is true, and we destroy ourselves if we have to do the latter.

## It's Much Too Heavy

Another reason people don't bother with eternity is because it's a heavy truth to bear and I can emphasize with this. If there is eternal consequence, then the implications are necessarily humungous and daunting. Usually this is for at least one of the following reasons.

1) If one can be humble and honest enough, they will know deep down that their eternal prospects (or those of a loved one) are probably bleak.
2) In order to live a life consistent with this viewpoint, it will require radical, uncomfortable and expensive changes to one's present lifestyle, and even identity.

This realization creates a conflict. If one becomes aware of this but is unwilling to embrace it, it's like being fast asleep, having the lights flicked on, suddenly seeing the horrible state of your circumstance and proceeding to smash all the light bulbs. The cognitive load of knowing the truth  but continuing to act as though it weren't is just too much. The only other option is to bludgeon your conscience to death, usually with whatever lies will allow you to live with some semblance of consistency.

What such a person needs to know is that their stance is not irredeemable at all. And that although they must by all means lose some things, they stand to gain infinitely more. Jesus captured this idea here:

> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.  
> **John 12:25**

The opportunity of this exchange is unreservedly tilted to our benefit. Lose something temporary to lay hold of something forever.

## Present Bias

The final reason is this: for many of us the, eternity is a notion entirely detached from the present moment. Eternity is not a pendant at the end of a daily chain of decisions, it's a pendant in a different country, on a different planet, in a different universe. The two could not be further.

This person is simply focused on the present. They may not suffer from the other two reasons, but they may attend to eternal matters too late. "I will do it later", and "I have time" are the song from the present minded man.

Jesus told a story about a similar shortsighted fellow and His words are as true now as they were then.

> But God said unto him, _Thou_ fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee...
> **Luke 12:20\[a]**

Because if there is eternity, then it isn't really something that happens after death. It's rather something we're currently in. Just as our present actions are shaping our present lives, they are also shaping eternity in bigger, truer ways.


## Closing Thoughts
So there we have it. In my experience, the 3 main reasons that people avoid eternity. I wonder if you see yourself in any of these? To Pascal, this was evidence of another force at work and the bible also has something to say about it.

> In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
>**2 Corinthians 4:4**  

I will leave you to make of that what you will. I do wish however, to point you to this fact. If we are blind to eternity, then we are blind to a kind of glory, reserved only for her.

> "Nature is mortal; we shall outlive her. When all the suns and nebulae have passed away, each one of you will still be alive. Nature is only the image, the symbol; but it is the symbol Scripture invites me to use. We are summoned to pass in through Nature, beyond her, into that splendour which she fitfully reflects."
> **C.S. Lewis, The Weight of Glory**  
 
The gospel of Christ is your invitation to glory. By receiving Him, a new eternity unfolds before you and it starts from right now. And here's the thing- it's not about what you've done or where you've been. It's only about who you trust.

> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
> **John 11:26**
