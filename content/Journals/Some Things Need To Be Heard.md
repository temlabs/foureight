## It's Not Your Fault

There's a scene in [[Good Will Hunting]] that moved me to tears the first time I watched it.

“It’s not your fault Will”. 

The first time Sean says this, Will dismisses it with an assured smile. But it’s overly assured. You can tell he’s working hard, working hard to convince himself. 

Sean, knows this and projects those tender words again.

“It’s not your fault, Will”.

And again, Will attempts to dismiss it. “Yeah, I know”. Obviously it's not his fault- he didn't choose or create his abusive circumstances. “Duh, I know that Sean”, he probably thinks. But at the same time, he is beginning to realise that that's the problem. He knows it but he doesn’t really believe it.

Will hates to see himself weak. He believes he is in control and is committed to never putting himself in positions of vulnerability. And since he is in complete control, then his situation _is_ his fault.

But he has never received these words from a source as credible as Sean. Who loves him. Who understands him because he's been through the very same thing.

The words feels like the crashing of waves against a sea wall. They are searching for new territories to breach.

“No Will, you understand what I’m saying? It’s not your fault”.

“Why do you keep…” will musters. 

Every time the words come, Will's resolve is weakened.

He knows it is the truth because he finds himself in need of it, thirsty for it. But this exchange will cost a lot. To receive it, he'll have to admit he is weak. And not because he is choosing to be in this moment, but because he really is.

## Every Word, a Little Deeper

Sean repeated the same words, but every time they went forth, they achieved a little bit more and went just a little bit further into Will's heart. 

Over the course of our lives, don't we, like Will also cling to wicked beliefs about ourselves? I realise that certain words must come from without, and from credible people who love us. There must be a voice to combat our own which all too is full of untruth. It must be heard audibly, that we might believe it, because it is not enough to merely know.

I once grabbed lunch with a friend on a windy day in London. At the time, I was in the throes of a faltering relationship that was struggling to stay afloat.

"Do you feel loved and valued by her?", my friend had asked. 

I couldn't explain to you just how much the question caught me off guard. I tried to gather all of the confidence I could hold onto, but my "Yes, of course!" was hesitant at best. I didn't know whether I was reassuring my concerned friend, or whether I was reassuring myself.

Suddenly I felt naked and embarrassed. Naked and embarrassed on Tottenham Court Road. Who did she take me for? I'm no fool. I'm not the type to be used and messed around with and undervalued. But then why was I so unsure?

Because in that moment, I was realizing that I knew I wasn't being treated right, and that I was doing myself a disservice.

My friend continued.

"You deserve much more...". This friend would not relent. More words would follow. A barrage of affirming truths were lavished on me. Words describing my qualities and virtues. My worth. All the things I knew and didn't believe.

"Anyway, I need to get back my office".

I was relieved to hear those words- the spotlight could finally be turned away from my betrayal if self. I walked back to my office slowly. By the time I had reached the revolving doors of the lobby, the collar of my jacket was wet with tears.

No one who knew me well had really ever spoken to me like that before. I was undone, and I had received a new ability to believe.

## Faith Comes By Hearing

It shouldn't surprise us then, that the bible tells us:

> So then faith _comes_ by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
> - **Romans 10:17**

Faith is created in words spoken. I've found this to be true man times over. Growing up, we don't really choose what we believe about ourselves. We become products of our circumstances and it isn't our fault. But we needn't be stuck in our ways. In order to believe the truth about ourselves, all we need to do is hear the truth about ourselves. When you know the truth about yourself, you're able to live freely.

Therefore, it's important to surround ourselves with people who know us, and I mean _really_ know us, and love us all the same. But even the best of people will get it wrong on occasion.

I therefore reason that there is no one more qualified to speak to us about ourselves, than God.

Since:
- He **understands** us, having Himself become a man.
- He **loves** us at our worst, enough to die for us.
- He **knows** us and sees us- even the hairs on our head our numbered.
- His word is the **true**, and only the truth.
- His intentions and thoughts toward you are **good**. He has your best interests at heart.

He has spoken to us by His Word. It remains for us to repeat those words, and put ourselves in the way of them, until we believe them.

Okay, but what if you've never heard what God has to say about you. Perhaps you've heard a few things here and there but aren't really sure. Heck, maybe you don't even believe in God. If any of those are you, I'd like to encourage you to taste and see for yourself.

Will Hunting didn't know that he'd become [[Good Will Hunting]] when he stepped into Sean's office. Similarly, you don't know what God has in store for you. But it starts when you step into His office, and begin to hear those beautiful, beautiful words.
