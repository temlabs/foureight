## It's Not Your Fault

There's a scene in [[Good Will Hunting]] that moved me to tears the first time I watched it.

“It’s not your fault, Will”.

The first time Sean says this, Will dismisses it with an overly assured smile. You can tell he’s working hard to convince himself.

Sean knows this. He projects those tender words again.

“It’s not your fault, Will”.

And again, Will attempts to dismiss it. “Yeah, I know”. But that's the problem. He only knows; he doesn’t really believe it.

There is a part of him responding to Sean, and it's the part of himself he hates—his weakness. Feigning strength is how he learned to respond to abuse. Now, he needs to always feel like he's in control and is committed to never putting himself in positions of vulnerability.

But he has never received these words from a source as credible as Sean. A man who respects him, loves him, and understands him because he's been through the very same thing.

It's why the words are becoming too much to bear. They feel like waves crashing against a sea wall. They are searching for territory hidden deep within Will's estate.

“No, Will, you understand what I’m saying? It’s not your fault”.

“Why do you keep…” will musters.

Every time the words come, his resolve is weakened a little more.

He wants to permit Sean's words; he knows he needs them. But to receive them, he'll have to admit that he is weak. And not because he is choosing to be in this moment, but because he really is.

## Every Word, a Little Deeper

Sean repeated the same words, but every time they went forth, they achieved a little bit more and went just a little bit further into Will's heart.

Over the course of our lives, don't we, like Will, also learn to kill off the parts of ourselves that make us feel weak? There are words that, when spoken, pass through walls and wander the wildernesses of our hearts without permission. They search us out and liberate those parts of ourselves from the tyranny of our pain and shame. And they must, by necessity, come from without.

I once grabbed lunch with a friend on a windy day in London. At the time, I was in the throes of a faltering relationship that was struggling to stay afloat.

We were making our way back after enjoying some pizza. My friend stared at me intently. "Do you feel loved and valued by her?"

I couldn't explain to you just how much the question caught me off guard. I looked away. I tried to gather all the self-assurance I could find, but the "Yes, of course!" I came up with was hesitant at best. I didn't know whether I was reassuring my concerned friend or whether I was reassuring myself.

Suddenly, I felt naked and embarrassed in the middle of Tottenham Court Road. Who did she take me for? I'm no fool. I'm not the type to be used, messed around with, and undervalued. But if that were true, then why was I so unsure?

I was unsure because in that moment, I knew that I had been compromised. I didn't want to acknowledge that there was a part of me that had *needs*. Needs that I was embarrassed to admit I had. Needs that weren't being met. While I'd worked tirelessly to hide every trace of neediness from my personhood (and thought I'd done a good job), I'd been made. The words of my friend had discovered it, and that part of me was crying out.

"You deserve much more...", my friend continued. More words would follow. A barrage of affirming truths were lavished on me. Words describing my qualities and virtues. My worth. That my needs were valid. That *I* was valid. All the things I knew and didn't believe.

"Anyway, I need to get back my office".

I was relieved to hear those words—the spotlight could finally be turned away from my nakedness. I walked back to my office slowly. By the time I had reached the revolving doors of the lobby, the collar of my jacket was wet with tears.

No one who knew me well had ever really spoken to me like that before. I was undone, and moreover, I believed something new, something better about myself.

## Faith Comes By Hearing

It shouldn't surprise us then, that the bible tells us:

> So then faith _comes_ by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
> **Romans 10:17**

Faith is created in words spoken. I've found this to be true again and again. Growing up, we don't really choose what we believe about ourselves. We become products of our circumstances and often through no fault of our own, inherit our self beliefs. But we needn't remain therein. To believe the truth about ourselves, all we need to do is hear the truth about ourselves. And when we believe the truth about ourselves, we can live freely.

It’s therefore important to surround ourselves with people who know us, and I mean _really_ know us—and love us all the same.

But even still, the best of people get it wrong on occasion.

And on that count, I reason that there is no one more qualified to speak to us about ourselves than God.

Since:
- He **understands** us, having Himself become a man.
- He **loves** us at our worst, enough to die for us.
- He **knows** us and sees us- even the hairs on our head are numbered.
- His word is **truth**, and only the truth.
- His intentions and thoughts toward you are **good**. He has our best interests at heart.

He has spoken to us by His Word. It remains for us to repeat those words, and put ourselves in the way of them, until we believe them.

Okay, but what if you've never heard what God has to say about you? Perhaps you've heard a few things here and there but aren't really sure. Heck, maybe you don't even believe in God in the first place. If any of those are you, I'd like to encourage you to taste and see for yourself. His Word is full of grace and truth.

Will Hunting didn't know that he'd become [[Good Will Hunting]] when he stepped into Sean's office. Similarly, you don't know what God has in store for you. But it starts when you step into His office, and put yourself in the way of those beautiful, beautiful words.
