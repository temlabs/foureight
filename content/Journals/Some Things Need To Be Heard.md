## It's Not Your Fault

There's a scene in [[Good Will Hunting]] that moved me to tears the first time I watched it.

“It’s not your fault, Will”.

The first time Sean says this, Will dismisses it with an overly assured smile. You can tell he’s working hard to convince himself.

And so Sean sends forth those tender words again.

“It’s not your fault, Will”.

And yet again, Will dismisses it. “Yeah, I know”, he quips as if it’s common knowledge. And that's the problem. He only knows it; he doesn’t really believe it.

There is a part of him responding to Sean, and it's the part of himself he hates—his weakness. Feigning strength is how he learned to cope with abuse. He formed a treaty within himself, to never allow anyone to take advantage, to be suspicious of authority and to always stay in control.

But he has never received these words from a source as credible as Sean. A man who respects him, and understands him because he's been through the very same thing.

It's why the words are becoming too much to bear. They feel like waves crashing against the walls of a fortress. They are searching for a hidden territory deep within Will's estate.

“No, Will, you understand what I’m saying? It’s not your fault”.

“Why do you keep…” will musters.

Every time the words come, the fortress is compromised a little more.

He wants to permit Sean's words; the weakness in him cries out for them. But to receive them he'll have to admit that such a part exists at all; that he is indeed weak. And not because he is choosing to be in this moment, but because he really is.

## Every Word, a Little Deeper

Over the course of our lives, don't we, like Will, also learn to kill off the parts of ourselves that make us ashamed? Yet, there are words that, when spoken, elude our strongest guards and wander these wildernesses of our hearts without permission. They search us out and liberate those parts of ourselves from the tyranny of our pain and shame. And they must, by necessity, come from without, and come often, until we believe them.

I’m reminded of a time I grabbed lunch with a friend, one windy day in London. At the time, I was in the throes of a faltering relationship that was struggling to stay afloat.

We were making our way back after enjoying some pizza. My friend stared at me intently. "Do you feel loved and valued by her?"

I couldn't explain to you just how much the question caught me off guard. I looked away. Gather all the composure I could find, I returned a doubtful "Yes, of course!". I didn't know whether I was reassuring my concerned friend or whether I was reassuring myself.

Suddenly, I felt naked and embarrassed in the middle of Tottenham Court Road. Who did she take me for? I'm no fool. I'm not the type to be messed around with and undervalued.

But if that were true, why couldn’t I respond thusly?

I was unsure because in that moment, I knew her words had infiltrated me. I didn't want to acknowledge that there was a part of me that had *needs*. Needs that I was embarrassed to admit I had. Needs that weren't being met. Somewhere along the line, I had picked up the belief that it was a shameful thing for me to have needs. And while I'd worked tirelessly to hide every trace of neediness from my personhood (and thought I'd done a good job), the words of my friend had discovered them, and that part of me was crying out.

"You deserve much more...", my friend continued. More words would follow. A barrage of affirming truths were lavished on me. Words describing my qualities and virtues. My worth. That my needs were valid. That *I* was valid. All the things I knew and didn't believe.

"Anyway, I need to get back my office".

I was relieved to hear those words—the spotlight could finally be turned away from my nakedness. I walked back to my office slowly. By the time I had reached the revolving doors of the lobby, the collar of my jacket was wet with tears.

No one who knew me well had ever really spoken to me like that before. I was undone, and moreover, I believed something new, something better about myself.

## Faith Comes By Hearing

It shouldn't surprise us then, that the bible tells us:

> So then faith _comes_ by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
> **Romans 10:17**

Faith is created in words spoken. I've found this to be true again and again. Growing up, we don't really choose what we believe about ourselves. We become products of our circumstances and often through no fault of our own, inherit our self perceptions. But we needn't remain therein. To believe the truth about ourselves, all we need to do is hear the truth about ourselves. And when we believe the truth about ourselves, we can live freely.

It’s therefore important to surround ourselves with people who know us, and I mean _really_ know us—and love us all the same.

But even still, the best of people get it wrong on occasion.

And on that count, I reason that there is no one more qualified to speak to us about ourselves than God.

Since:
- He **understands** us, having Himself become a man and borne our weakness.
- He **loves** us at our worst, enough to die for us.
- He **knows** us and sees us- even the hairs on our head are numbered.
- His word is **truth**, and only the truth.
- His intentions and thoughts toward us are **good**. He has our best interests at heart.

He has spoken to us by His Word. It remains for us to repeat those words, and put ourselves in the way of them, until we believe them.

Okay, but what if you've never heard what God has to say about you? Perhaps you've heard a few things here and there but aren't really sure. Heck, maybe you don't even believe in God in the first place. If any of those are you, I'd like to encourage you to taste and see for yourself. His Word is full of grace and truth.

Will Hunting didn't know that he'd become [[Good Will Hunting|*Good* Will Hunting]] when he stepped into Sean's office. Similarly, you don't know what God has in store for you. But it starts when you step into His office, and put yourself in the way of those beautiful, beautiful words.
