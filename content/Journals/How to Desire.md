>Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: But when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.

The colour of life is in the fulfilment of desires. In fact, according to the bible, achieving our goals is deeply *good* for us. Many studies on happiness have been undertaken to confirm this. Some people try to avoid the pain and sickness of heart that comes disappointment by subduing all of their hopes and desires. But if they succeed, they also deny themselves a tree of life. On this count alone, I judge that it is better to have hopes and desires. But how should we treat our desires really? I have found three mistakes to make when it comes to desire and I have made all three of them.

## Mistaking a whims for desires

Some desires are present but for a moment, then just as quickly they sail off like clouds in the sky. We shouldn't call them desires - they are whims. And to be lead by whims is the perfect setup for a life full of fitful angst and confusion. Our whims constantly betray us.

I often experience this when I'm out. A pang of hunger rises up from within me and I heed it. After much umm-ing and ah-ing, I find a restaurant, but when I get there, I realize I'm not actually that hungry. And then I see the price, or the length of the queue, and I realize I'm not even hungry at all. If I stubbornly chase the fleeting whim and end up eating, I feel cheated when I finish.

Desires need to be *tried*. It's the ones that persist, recur, and nudge incessantly that we ought to pay attention to. It's hard work trying to discern these in ourselves but it's worth it. In doing so, we ourselves from the tyranny of our whims.

## Going after desires that aren't ours

Here's the second mistake - lying about what we *really* want. Some desires are shameful and reveal uncomeliness in us. Others are so absurd and big and ridiculous that we fear we'd only betray ourselves if we admit them. And for these reasons, it's easy to lie to yourself about you really want.

Now, I must add a caveat. I don't belong to school of thought that says a desire must be legitimate simply because it exists. I believe that some desires are illegitimate and must not be heeded. But even still, they have to be explored if we'll have any hope of mastering them. I often find desires in myself that are uncouth to say the least. But I don't pretend they aren't there - I inspect them, understand their origins and put them down.

We ought to be real enough with ourselves to admit all of the desires we have, and sort them out. Desires can be many things, but one thing they *must* be is our own. Not the desires and goals you wish you had. Not the desires and goals it is trendy to have. The desires and goals you actually have. Next to the person who is lead by whims is the person whose real desires are hidden to him. The former is full of vanity, but the latter stumbles around in the dark of their deception. Both are ultimately unhappy.

The most liberating you can do sometimes is admitting to yourself "I don't actually want this.", or, "I do want this".


## Not Committing to Your Desires

>The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.  
>**Proverbs 21:25**

The third mistake is this. To stop at simply desiring. A person making this mistake knows his/her real desires and allows him/herself to become subject the right ones. However, such a person doesn't commit to them for laziness or for lack of faithfulness*. 

Each desire is a bullet in a gun pointing right back at them. They talk about their goals and plans. Dream about them. They whet the expectations of onlookers and hide behind 'potential'. But it's all hot air. And in time, the hot air develops into a category 5 hurricane of frustration, bitterness and regret. The inability to go after something (not everything - you must decide) you truly want and commit to it leads to death.

Lazy, unfaithful people are puffed up with purposes, full of activity and have absolutely zilch to show for it. They don't want to pay the price that fulfilling a desire requires. Eventually, they end up blaming external factors, or berating themselves. But it could all have been avoided with the appropriate commitment and labour.

In truth, I find myself here the most, but I've been making in progress in being super selective about the desires I pursue and committing to them. No matter how frightening it may seem, the alternative is far worse.

Ironically, the next most liberating you can do is committing. I mean exclusively choosing an aim, and at the cost of not pursuing the others, pursuing it with your might. In doing so, you free yourself from the middle age regret and anxiety that comes from time wasted.

So here's to desiring, having goals, and NOT letting them kill us.


\* I think these are actually the same thing. I'll explore this in another post.
